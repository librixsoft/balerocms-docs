# Cache Folder

The "/cache/" folder stores **auto-generated cache files** used by the application to improve routing performance.

## Notes

- Cached files are **automatically generated** when the application starts.
- Do **not edit manually**. If missing, the app will scan the `App/Controllers` directory dynamically.
