# BaleroCMS Documentation Site

Quick guide to install, preview, build, and deploy this documentation site.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Installation

Install MkDocs and the Material theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

(Optional) The extensions referenced in `mkdocs.yml` are included with `mkdocs-material`.

## Run locally (preview)

Start the dev server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with live reload:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Build the static site

Generate the `site/` folder ready to host on any static hosting:

```bash
mkdocs build --clean
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project targets GitHub Pages (`site_url` points to `librixsoft.github.io/balerocms-docs`).

Manual deploy (creates/updates the `gh-pages` branch):

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean --force
```

- `--clean`: removes obsolete files on `gh-pages`.
- `--force`: forces the push even with local changes.

Ensure you have push permissions and Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Relevant structure

- `docs/`: Markdown content for the site
- `mkdocs.yml`: MkDocs configuration (theme, navigation, extensions)
- `site/`: static output generated by `mkdocs build` (usually not versioned)

## Notes

- Navigation in `mkdocs.yml` references files without numeric prefixes.
- The initial installation content is integrated into `docs/index.md`.
